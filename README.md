# Universe Database for Power Electronics

## Power Semiconductors Basic Features
When developing power converters or power systems, the features of power semiconductors are important. 
However, if we look into all the products on the shelf, the ways to obtain their key characteristics are overwhelmingly various. 
Datasheets are different, and we may be able to use NLM to abstract the information we need. 
Going further, if we want to compare the dynamics, the problems get more disgusting. The simulation models are multifarious. 

In conclusion, when deciding the power semiconductors to use, variaty of their description makes it difficult to do a horizontal comparison. 
There should be a universe database for all power semiconductor products. 


## Tests Results
This would be more difficult. 
Nowadays, almost all the tests (electrical, thermal, or other tests) on the semiconductors are confidential to the performer. 
I can understand this phenomenon since the performer spent money and time on this. 
However, it's wrong. It's hurting the whole industry and it's hurting themselves. 
Data sharing would be necessary for the future. And we will try to make a standard on how the teting data should be shared. 
Surely the Patentability and Originality must be protected.
